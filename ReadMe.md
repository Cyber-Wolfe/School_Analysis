# School Grade Analysis

## Overview
Thomas High School ninth graders seem to have had their grades altered thus tampering with the academic integrity of their school and by association the school's in the area. The data from that school had to be replaced with nulls and all the analysis done previously had to be done again.

## Results

* The effect that the audit had on the district summary was minimal at best. Pulling one number out of this semi large set that was similar to the rest changed next to nothing. ![District_Summary.png](https://github.com/Cyber-Wolfe/School_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pictures/District_Summary.PNG)

* The school summary though had a little more  seems that when the data was recalculated it shows that whoever tampered with the school data of Thomas High School was trying to damage their overall performance. In the before we can see the Average Math, Reading, Passing Math, Passing Reading, and overall go from low scores to high scores. ![Before_Audit_of_Thomas](https://github.com/Cyber-Wolfe/School_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pictures/Before_Audit_of_Thomas.PNG) ![After_Audit_of_Thomas](https://github.com/Cyber-Wolfe/School_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pictures/After_Audit_of_Thomas.PNG)

* If those students had done well and were removed, the scrores wouldn't have shifted nearly as much. Replacing those scores did more for the school's performance metric instead.

* Replacing the grades in the Math and Reading makes all the scores look even, no school does higher than 84% on math and on reading no school has higher than 85%.

* The chart shows that the less money spent gives the best performance from the students.

* The best scores come from the smallet schools, more attention per student.

* Even with the 9th graders from Thomas removed, the Charter schools come out on top with the highest scores.

The handful of changes that were the four overall grades changing from 83.35, 83.89, 66.91, 69.66, and 65.07 to 83.35, 83.89, 93.18, 97.01, and 90.63 respectively. Which shows that removing the scores created a better visualiztion of peforance.
